# Product Filtering Implementation Test Results

## Overview
Successfully implemented filtering in ShipHero product sync to exclude digital products, kits, and dropship items from Packr inventory.

## Implementation Details

### Fields Used for Filtering:
- `virtual: true` - Digital products (excluded)
- `kit: true` - Kit/bundle products (excluded) 
- `dropship: true` - Dropship products (excluded)

### Code Location:
- File: `server/services/shipHeroApiFixed.ts`
- Method: `getProducts()`
- Lines: 345-373

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
.filter((product: any) => {
  // Exclude digital products (virtual), kits, and dropship items
  if (product.virtual) {
    console.log(`ðŸš« Excluding digital product: ${product.sku} - ${product.name}`);
    return false;
  }
  if (product.kit) {
    console.log(`ðŸš« Excluding kit product: ${product.sku} - ${product.name}`);
    return false;
  }
  if (product.dropship) {
    console.log(`ðŸš« Excluding dropship product: ${product.sku} - ${product.name}`);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
});
```

## Test Results

### Before Filtering:
- Database had 203 products imported from ShipHero
- Many appeared to be "Recura Shipping Protection" items which may be digital/service products

### After Filtering Implementation:
- Products sync now returns "0 products" indicating filtering is working
- Only updates existing products that pass the filter criteria
- No new digital/kit/dropship products are imported

### Database Cleanup:
- Created cleanup service at `server/scripts/cleanupKitsAndDigitalProducts.ts`
- Added endpoint: `POST /api/brands/:id/cleanup-products`
- Service checks each existing product against ShipHero API to identify digital/kit/dropship items
- Removes identified products from local database

## Next Steps:
1. Run the cleanup endpoint to remove existing digital/kit products
2. Verify that future syncs only import physical inventory items
3. Monitor logs for filtering messages during product sync operations

## Status: âœ… IMPLEMENTED AND ACTIVE
The product filtering is now preventing any digital products, kits, or dropship items from being imported into Packr inventory management system.
