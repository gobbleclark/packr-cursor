# Overview

This is a comprehensive 3PL (Third-Party Logistics) management SaaS platform built with React and Express.js. The application enables 3PL companies to manage their brand clients through a complete invitation workflow, handle support tickets, track orders, manage inventory, and integrate with both ShipHero and Trackstar APIs for universal WMS connectivity. It features role-based access control with three user types: administrators, 3PL managers, and brand users, each with tailored dashboards and permissions. The platform aims to provide a unified solution for 3PL operations, enhancing efficiency and client management.
