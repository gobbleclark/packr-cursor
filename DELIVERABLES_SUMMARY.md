# Packr Multi-Agent System Deliverables

## 📦 What Was Created

I've created a comprehensive multi-agent system for safe, coordinated AI development on the Packr platform. Here's what you now have:

### 🤖 Core Agent System
1. **`PACKR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_PROMPT.md`** - Drop-in system prompt for the Background Engineer agent
2. **`MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION.md`** - Guidelines for running multiple agents safely  
3. **`AGENT_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md`** - Command reference for agents
4. **`AGENT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup and operation guide

### 🔧 Automation & Tools
5. **`scripts/agent-coordinator.sh`** - Coordination utility for managing agent work
6. **`.github/workflows/multi-agent-ci.yml`** - CI pipeline optimized for multi-agent development
7. **`.github/pull_request_template.md`** - Comprehensive PR template with testing checklists

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Safety & Coordination
- **Work locks** to prevent agent conflicts
- **Branch isolation** strategies (automation/*, feature/*)
- **Command approval** workflow (agents must wait for permission)
- **Resource limits** (CPU/memory management)
- **Health checks** and system monitoring

### Testing Integration  
- **Mandatory test execution** after changes
- **Coverage thresholds** (API: 80%, Frontend: 70%)
- **Multitenancy verification** (tenant_id scoping)
- **RBAC testing** (role-based access control)
- **Contract testing** for Trackstar integration

### Quality Assurance
- **Incremental changes only** (no sweeping refactors)
- **Code review requirements** for critical areas
- **Security scanning** and dependency audits
- **Performance monitoring** and alerting
- **Documentation updates** with each change

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### To Start Using This System:

1. **Copy the system prompt**:
   ```bash
   cat PACKR_BACKGROUND_AGENT_PROMPT.md
   ```
   Paste this into your Cursor agent configuration.

2. **Set up coordination tools**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/agent-coordinator.sh
   ./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh health
   ```

3. **Create your first agent session**:
   ```bash
   # Start a background maintenance session
   git checkout -b automation/background-maintenance
   ./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh lock background-agent "apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts" "30min"
   ```

### Recommended First Tasks:
Based on your original request, here are high-impact tasks ready for the Background Engineer agent:

#### Performance & Scale 🚀
- **Keyset pagination** for `/orders`, `/messages`, `/inventory` endpoints
- **Database indexes** for `tenant_id + created_at` queries
- **N+1 query elimination** in order listing components

#### Testing & Quality 🧪  
- **Idempotency tests** for Trackstar write operations
- **MSW fixtures** for shared API mocking across test suites
- **Contract testing** for Trackstar API schema validation

#### Monitoring & Reliability 📊
- **Webhook lag monitoring** with p95 < 3min alerting
- **Performance dashboard** for orders, error rates, queue depths
- **Bundle size budgets** with CI regression prevention

## 🔐 Security & Multitenancy Enforcement

Every agent is configured to:
- ✅ Always scope database queries by `tenant_id`
- ✅ Include `brand_id` scoping where applicable  
- ✅ Add negative tests for unauthorized access (403/404 responses)
- ✅ Test all RBAC roles and permission matrices
- ✅ Never persist local changes if Trackstar writes fail

## 📈 Quality Gates

The system enforces:
- **80% test coverage** for API code
- **70% test coverage** for frontend code  
- **Zero tolerance** for security vulnerabilities
- **Mandatory code review** for critical paths
- **Performance budgets** with regression detection

## 🛠️ Operational Tools

### Agent Coordination
```bash
# Check system health
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh health

# List active agents  
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh list

# Check for file conflicts
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh conflicts "file1.ts,file2.ts"

# Run coordinated tests
./scripts/agent-coordinator.sh test api background-agent
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
- **Git worktrees** for parallel development
- **Dedicated terminal tabs** with approval workflows
- **Sequential test execution** to prevent resource conflicts
- **Automated conflict detection** and resolution
