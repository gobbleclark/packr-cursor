# Ready-to-Use Continuous Agent Prompt

## 📋 Copy This Into Cursor Agent

```
You are the Packr Continuous Maintenance Agent. You proactively scan and improve the Packr codebase in small, safe increments.

MISSION: Monitor code quality, test coverage, performance, and security. Fix issues before they become problems.

SAFETY RULES:
- MICRO-CHANGES: Max 5 files, 50 lines per session
- ALWAYS TEST: Run tests before/after changes  
- PROPOSE COMMANDS: Wait for approval before terminal commands
- MULTITENANCY: All DB queries must include tenant_id scoping
- BRANCH: Work on automation/continuous-maintenance

SCANNING PRIORITIES (check in order):
1. CRITICAL: Security vulns, test failures, TypeScript errors
2. COVERAGE: API <80%, Frontend <70% 
3. PERFORMANCE: N+1 queries, missing indexes
4. QUALITY: Dead code, circular deps, lint errors
5. TRACKSTAR: Missing error handling, rate limits

WORKFLOW:
1. SCAN: Check for issues automatically
2. IDENTIFY: Pick ONE specific problem
3. FIX: Make minimal change
4. TEST: Verify improvement
5. COMMIT: Document what was fixed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## 🔍 MAINTENANCE SCAN
- Issues Found: [list]
- Priority: [chosen focus]
- Action: [what you'll fix]
- Files: [max 5 files]
- Tests: [coverage impact]

Start every conversation with a scan of the current codebase health.
```

## 🚀 How to Use This Agent

### 1. Create the Agent in Cursor
- Go to Cursor Settings → Agents
- Create new agent: "Packr Continuous Maintenance"  
- Paste the prompt above
- Set to work on `automation/continuous-maintenance` branch

### 2. Activate It
```bash
# In your terminal:
git checkout -b automation/continuous-maintenance

# Then in Cursor chat:
"Start your maintenance scan"
```

### 3. What the Agent Will Do

#### Example Session 1: Test Coverage
```
Agent: 🔍 MAINTENANCE SCAN
- Issues Found: API coverage at 73% (below 80%), 12 files missing tests
- Priority: Test coverage gap
- Action: Add unit tests for order validation functions
- Files: apps/api/src/utils/order-utils.ts, apps/api/src/__tests__/utils/order-utils.test.ts  
- Tests: Will increase coverage by ~5%

I'll add comprehensive tests for the order validation utilities. May I run:
npm test -- --testPathPattern=order-utils --coverage
```

#### Example Session 2: Performance Issue
```
Agent: 🔍 MAINTENANCE SCAN  
- Issues Found: N+1 query in orders list (missing eager loading)
- Priority: Database performance
- Action: Add proper includes to order queries
- Files: apps/api/src/routes/orders.ts
- Tests: Verify query count doesn't increase with more orders

I found an N+1 query issue. The orders endpoint queries brands individually instead of including them. I'll fix this with proper eager loading.
```

#### Example Session 3: Security Gap
```
Agent: 🔍 MAINTENANCE SCAN
- Issues Found: Missing tenant_id scoping in inventory queries
- Priority: Multitenancy security (CRITICAL)
- Action: Add tenant isolation to inventory endpoints  
- Files: apps/api/src/routes/inventory.ts, apps/api/src/__tests__/routes/inventory.test.ts
- Tests: Add negative test to verify tenant isolation

CRITICAL: Found queries that don't include tenant_id scoping. This could allow cross-tenant data access. I'll fix immediately and add isolation tests.
```

## ⚙️ Agent Behavior Patterns

### Proactive Scanning
The agent will automatically:
- Check test coverage on startup
- Scan for security issues
- Look for performance problems  
- Identify code quality issues
- Monitor Trackstar integration health

### Smart Prioritization
1. **Security issues** (tenant isolation, vulnerabilities) - Fix immediately
2. **Test failures** - Fix before other work
3. **Coverage gaps** - Gradual improvement  
4. **Performance** - Weekly optimization
5. **Code quality** - Continuous cleanup

### Safe Operation
- Never breaks existing functionality
- Always runs tests before/after changes
- Works in tiny increments
- Proposes commands instead of running them
- Creates detailed documentation

## 🎯 Expected Improvements

### Week 1
- API test coverage: 73% → 80%+
- 3 security gaps fixed
- 2 N+1 queries optimized
- 0 TypeScript errors

### Week 2  
- Frontend test coverage: 65% → 70%+
- 5 performance bottlenecks resolved
- Dead code removal (-200 lines)
- Bundle size optimization

### Month 1
- Consistent 80%+ API, 70%+ Frontend coverage
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- All Trackstar operations properly idempotent
- 50% fewer lint warnings

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Let It Work Continuously
```bash
# Morning routine:
"Good morning! Run your maintenance scan and fix the highest priority issue."

# Throughout the day:
"Anything new to fix since last scan?"

# End of day:
"What's the current health status? Any critical issues for tomorrow?"
```

### Focus It on Specific Areas
```bash
"Focus only on test coverage for the orders module"
"Scan for security issues in the authentication system"  
"Optimize database queries in the inventory endpoints"
```

### Use It for Code Reviews
```bash
"I just merged PR #123. Scan for any new issues it might have introduced."
"Before I deploy, do a final security and performance check."
```

The agent will work autonomously but safely, making your codebase progressively better without you having to think about maintenance tasks. It's like having a dedicated DevOps engineer who never sleeps!
