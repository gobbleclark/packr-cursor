## Testing Checklist

### API Tests (Required for API changes)
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests cover API endpoints with database
- [ ] Multitenancy isolation verified (`tenant_id` scoping)
- [ ] RBAC scenarios tested (different user roles)
- [ ] Trackstar integration tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Coverage threshold maintained (≥80%)

### Frontend Tests (Required for UI changes)
- [ ] Component tests added/updated  
- [ ] User interaction flows tested
- [ ] API mocking implemented with MSW
- [ ] Accessibility tests included
- [ ] Responsive design tested
- [ ] Coverage threshold maintained (≥70%)

### Specialized Tests
- [ ] Webhook idempotency verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior tested (Trackstar: 10 req/sec)
- [ ] Error scenarios and edge cases covered
- [ ] Performance regression tested
- [ ] Database migration tested (if applicable)

### Security & Compliance Tests
- [ ] **Multitenancy isolation**: Cannot access other tenant data
- [ ] **Brand isolation**: Cannot access other brand data  
- [ ] **RBAC verification**: Proper role-based access control
- [ ] **Negative tests**: 403/404 responses for unauthorized access
- [ ] **Input validation**: Malformed/malicious data handling
- [ ] **No sensitive data**: No secrets, keys, or PII in tests

## Code Quality Checklist

### General Standards
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)  
- [ ] Formatting applied (`npm run format`)
- [ ] No console.log/debug statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling implemented appropriately
- [ ] Meaningful variable and function names

### Packr-Specific Standards
- [ ] **Trackstar integration**: Proper error handling and idempotency
- [ ] **Database queries**: Include appropriate indexes and tenant scoping
- [ ] **API responses**: Consistent error format and status codes
- [ ] **Frontend components**: Follow design system patterns
- [ ] **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

## Multitenancy & Security Verification

### Data Isolation (Critical)
- [ ] All database queries include `WHERE tenant_id = ?`
- [ ] Brand-specific queries include `WHERE brand_id = ?` 
- [ ] No cross-tenant data leakage possible
- [ ] Audit logging captures tenant context

### Test Coverage for Security
```typescript
// Required negative test pattern:
it('should not access other tenant data', async () => {
  const tenant1Resource = await createResource(tenant1.id);
  const tenant2User = await createUser(tenant2.id);
  
  await request(app)
    .get(`/api/resource/${tenant1Resource.id}`)
    .set('Authorization', tenant2User.token)
    .expect(403);
});
```

### Role Matrix Testing
- [ ] `SUPER_ADMIN`: Can access all resources
- [ ] `TENANT_ADMIN`: Can access tenant resources only  
- [ ] `BRAND_ADMIN`: Can access brand resources only
- [ ] `BRAND_USER`: Can access limited brand resources
- [ ] `READ_ONLY`: Cannot modify any resources

## Performance Considerations

### Database Performance
- [ ] Query performance tested with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Appropriate indexes created/verified
- [ ] N+1 query problems avoided
- [ ] Pagination implemented for large datasets

### Frontend Performance  
- [ ] Bundle size impact measured (`npm run analyze`)
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented where appropriate
- [ ] No memory leaks in components
- [ ] Optimistic updates for better UX

### Trackstar Integration
- [ ] Rate limiting respected (10 requests/second)
- [ ] Proper retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Timeout handling implemented
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern (if high volume)

## Observability & Monitoring

### Logging
- [ ] Appropriate log levels used (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Error logs include actionable context

### Metrics  
- [ ] Key business metrics tracked
- [ ] Performance metrics captured
- [ ] Error rates monitored
- [ ] Custom dashboards updated (if needed)

### Alerts
